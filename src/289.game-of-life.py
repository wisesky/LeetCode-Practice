# According toÂ Wikipedia's article: "The Game of Life, also known simply as
# Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John
# Horton Conway in 1970."
# 
# The board is made up of an m x n grid of cells, where each cell has an
# initial state: live (represented by a 1) or dead (represented by a 0). Each
# cell interacts with its eight neighbors (horizontal, vertical, diagonal)
# using the following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia
# article):
# 
# 
# Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies as if caused by
# under-population.
# Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next
# generation.
# Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by
# over-population.
# Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by
# reproduction.
# 
# 
# The next state is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every
# cell in the current state, where births and deaths occur simultaneously.
# Given the current state of the m x n grid board, return the next state.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: board = [[0,1,0],[0,0,1],[1,1,1],[0,0,0]]
# Output: [[0,0,0],[1,0,1],[0,1,1],[0,1,0]]
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: board = [[1,1],[1,0]]
# Output: [[1,1],[1,1]]
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# m == board.length
# n == board[i].length
# 1 <= m, n <= 25
# board[i][j] is 0 or 1.
# 
# 
# 
# Follow up:
# 
# 
# Could you solve it in-place? Remember that the board needs to be updated
# simultaneously: You cannot update some cells first and then use their updated
# values to update other cells.
# In this question, we represent the board using a 2D array. In principle, the
# board is infinite, which would cause problems when the active area encroaches
# upon the border of the array (i.e., live cells reach the border). How would
# you address these problems?
